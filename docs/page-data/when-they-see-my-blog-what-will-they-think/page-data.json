Maybe my mom has been right all along. I\\u2019ve always thought it was strange that my mom would climb all the way up to a Masters degree and then give it all up to take care of me and my siblings. Since then, she\\u2019s never taken up a full time job. I used to think, how does she deal with all that free time? How does she not get antsy? How does she deal with the fact that she isn\\u2019t making any money? I felt it was almost parasitic, which in hindsight, is just completely wrong. I didn\\u2019t give my mom credit for everything my dad put on her because she was \\u201Cjust sitting at home\\u201D, everything me and my siblings asked of her because she was \\u201Calways around\\u201D. I didn\\u2019t give her credit for how she had to self-motivate and self-learn with no schedule and no authority figure. I struggle immensely with the idea of free time, the need to be productive and climb to the top and gain recognition from peers. My mom somehow is able to disregard all the stigmas of not working and make something worthwhile of her time. Sure, I can\\u2019t always relate or understand, but she seems to find the most peculiar, niche things on the internet. She devours knowledge from books and courses. I always thought the new age stuff was a coping mechanism for the difficulties at home and whatever past traumas she may have had, but I don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s like that anymore. She\\u2019s evolving into a new chapter of her life, doing what makes her happy. When my dad eventually retires, I think he\\u2019ll have a lot to learn from my mom about how to spend his time.
