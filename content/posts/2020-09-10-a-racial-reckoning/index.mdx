I was listening to the [Throughline episode about the American caste system featuring Isabel Wilkerson](https://www.npr.org/2020/08/04/898918916/americas-caste-system#:~:text=America's%20Caste%20System%20%3A%20Throughline%20%22Race,that%20has%20shaped%20our%20country.) while doing my grocery shopping. It was fascinating and I might have to listen to it over again because the buses and cars and even the inside of Whole Foods were so noisy. 

I have been avoiding The Daily, one of my most regular podcasts, for a little bit because they’ve been putting out a lot of episodes regarding police brutality and victims like [Breonna Taylor](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/09/podcasts/the-daily/breonna-taylor.html). I don’t know why. 

I guess some possible reasons are:
- I‘m terrified of violence and listening to people report on it makes me feel sick and uncomfortable 
- I feel like I can’t relate or I’m not understanding it completely and never will
- I feel helpless about the situation, like either, I can’t do anything about it or the people in power aren’t going to do anything about it (nothing’s going to change)
- I think I’m not going to gain any new insights
- I’m tired of conversations about race (this is probably the most difficult to admit)

I think the same goes for just talking about race. It’s just really difficult because I am sympathetic and I am trying my best to learn.

I’ve been a good little liberal for a while now but in a very brainwashed sense, not in any sort of self-enlightened, fact-based way. I just accepted it all as correct and when I looked across the aisle, my logic decided I was on the right side of history. But because I never fully questioned where I am, why I think this way, I’ve also just not done my research on a lot of topics. 

When I was a leader of orientation leaders at uni, I was supposed to be thinking critically about race, gender, intersectionality, micro-aggressions, intent vs. impact, ALL THESE WORDS and DEFINITIONS I memorized. I graded other kids about their knowledge of these concepts. I kicked kids out of the program because I judged their knowledge to be insufficient and therefore they weren’t capable of chaperoning a bunch of first-years for a week. But I didn’t even take a lot of it seriously myself. I didn’t have conversations about race with my friends and family. I didn’t question my privilege beyond the color of my skin and my parents’ tax bracket. When the blackface incident happened and I pulled all my kids into a circle to talk about it, I put on a somber and polite face, but I hadn’t even digested why that situation was horrendous as it was headline-worthy. 

I was never really prepared at all. 

I believe the renewed strength of the Black Lives Matter movement, which has support from people of all color and in all parts of the nation, is in part propelled by the crisis of coronavirus. Forty million jobs lost. All classes have shifted down a rung on the proverbial ladder. People are upset, people have no work, it’s only a matter of time before they come out to the streets. So that makes sense.

But what changed between me from three years ago and me today? It hasn’t been truly a drastic change in perspective, but it’s a notable one. As of today, I still don’t have any Black friends. 

I guess some possible reasons are:
- I could hear and see protests happening up and down the streets for weeks on end and it was directly affecting my neighborhood
- It’s hard to ignore something that the nation is always talking about it
- I don’t want to be ignorant anymore

I own three books (I have less than 15 books) that are written by Black authors. I haven’t finished any of them. It’s been difficult to maintain the attention span I used to have for chapter books since my most regular forms of consumption are by Reddit headlines and award-winning podcasts. 

I wish that I could talk about this stuff with older generations, like my parents or older coworkers. It feels like there is an invisible barrier and it is too taboo to talk about. Or if you do, it won't be a fruitful conversation and you should just stick to your friends and r/BlackPeopleTwitter to educate yourself. 

I haven’t even begun to dig into my Asian American identity and how that complicates everything. It’s not the same as White Fragility, and it’s not the same kind of racism, but it’s this confusing mix of both. I can’t even remember the last time I experienced racism. I know not all Asians can fly under the radar like I have my whole life, but it’s a characteristic that makes it difficult for me to relate with other POC. 

It took me until college, maybe even post-grad, to understand the consequences of growing up in an Asian enclave. My lack of racist experiences in a racist America is one of them. My inability to digest racial conversations without feeling a little defensive is another. I’m not sure if my immigrant parents have had even a single conversation about racism with me.

I don’t know. 

Is it because as immigrants, all that matters is that you survive? Maybe. I don’t blame the immigrants for being selfish and ignoring the problems often country. They already got the short end of the stick. 

I get why white parents wouldn’t talk about race either. Who wants to tell their child that not many generations ago, their ancestors were slaveholders? No one wants to be told they have villainy in their genes.

I’m glad the nation is facing a racial reckoning, bigger than any in my lifetime. I can’t imagine an entire race carrying the burden of a tragic past and a tragic present. The hardest part for me is staying hopeful and staying engaged. The more I age, the more I realize how slow the gears of change move. And it’s working against us! Just so much bad shit is happening each day, it feels like even if the world could be in agreement about the horror that is happening and what they’ll do to fix it, it’ll be so late. So late. That’s the best-case scenario. 

I’m waiting for the cultural revolution to come tomorrow! But it won’t, and I know it. It just feels like I have no say in any of it anymore.
