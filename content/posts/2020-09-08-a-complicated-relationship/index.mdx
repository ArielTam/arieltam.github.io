When I was brushing my teeth, I remembered that time I went to Balboa Park with He-Who-Shall-Not-Be-Named. It was pitch black and he gave me a piggyback ride all the way to the car. And there were string lights and Spanish style buildings and big bushes and I wasn’t scared of anything. I don’t know why that memory came to me and I don’t know why it hurts so much even though I haven’t lived in California for over a year now. I haven’t had a real conversation with him in so long but I still miss him.

Yeah. Despite everything that I’m grateful for in my new Washingtonian life, I still miss him.

I had a conversation with S.O. just earlier on the sofa. I said there were two ways you could get hired, the academic way and the side projects way. I got hired the academic way, the good grades, the two summer internships, passing the technical interview with good old fashioned studying and banking on the behavioral to pull me through the finish line. I knew the technical stuff was never my strong suit. I repeated the same “I’m interested in frontend” line over and over even though I had no real experience in it. 

I just feel guilty that I don’t actually care for technology in the TECHNICAL way. I don’t have GitHub projects to show for. I can’t ever stick with anything long enough to complete it (*ahem* my senior project, the biggest failure of all time). I just don’t care.

If I had to do anything with technology, it wouldn’t be about my skills or trying to be at the cutting edge of anything. I have this pipe dream that I could somehow use it to change people’s lives, raise people out of poverty, change people’s minds, put power in the people’s hands.

S.O. gets excited about things like the Facebook redesign. He heard about the IMDB face lift that’s in progress and it practically gave him a boner except he is basically doing the same thing at his present company already. He has the React Native side project, his reddit fame from past prodigies. I feel bad that I’ll never be on the same level as engagement or excitement as he is. 

We talked about his rags to riches story on his technical skills. I’m still at rags and frankly, some days I am content with that. Of course I’d like to get better but I don’t feel like going out of my way anymore. I don’t know if it’s trauma from this team’s lack of mentorship or personal growth. I don’t know if it’s just me, that I’m inherently disinterested in growing technically if I’m not gonna be forced into it. 

I wanted my blog to not be tied to my identity because I don’t feel like I can live up to what a software engineer is. It’s not a lifestyle for me like it is for so many other people I know. People have their origin stories of getting into video games or building their own PC or tinkering with this or that. I’m basically the product of affirmative action. I succeed not out of passion or interest but out of obligation to live up to my own ideals of financial and material success. Sure I can find some joy in it, especially with the right people, but when it’s just me, I’m out. 

I feel so ashamed to admit this and I don’t know why. I’ve had so many opportunities since I was a kid that have been designed to turn me into some Female STEM Superhero/Advocate. Girl Scout Robotics, the Technovation Challenge, Grace Hopper (twice!). I didn’t have to earn any of it. I just showed up and now suddenly I’m a software engineer, supposedly some kind of expert at computers. 

The truth is, I suck at computers. I barely understand how the internet works and I don’t even care to really look it up. I google my way through college and work, but if I didn’t have that, I’d be a useless sack of shit. 

I don’t know why I’m being hard on myself. Nobody said I needed to be an expert in some language and have 10 side projects and contribute to open source and know how to fix hardware too. But it feels that way! How do you stand out as a candidate if you’re not already overqualified? Who’s going to notice or pick the candidate who meets the bare minimum, who says they’ll do what you ask of them and that’s it? If I were a hiring manager, of course the candidate with the side projects will win me over. That takes initiative! That takes dedication! They’re already skilled so no time is wasted on training! 

I’m scared of being a unqualified candidate! I know I don’t have much competition being a year out of college but it still feels that way. 

All this tech for social good is awesome and cool but honestly, it might just be a guise for me to escape further from tech. But if I say CS for social good, it’s like “oh ok you’re still a tech person. you’re just a little left of center, but your roots are still tech.” 

I don’t think that’s who I am. I think I truly don’t give a shit about technology. 

Maybe I’m a bit jaded too. I realized that these companies are kind of the bad guys wearing the hero’s cape. They steal people’s identities cuz it’s just “data” to them. They stomp out the little guys just tryna make a living. They use their power to stay in power, all while parading around in a shower of six figure salaries and insane stock options. The wealth gap grows ever larger. People just entering the game (new grads like myself!) act like they don’t have enough money. They negotiate from what is already an extremely inflated salary with generous benefits and then pout if it doesn’t go their way. It’s disgusting. No one in tech seems satisfied with the money in their pockets. Meanwhile the rest of the world is starving, suffering, helpless, and what are we doing? Nothing. Upset that the free snacks aren’t the good ones you wanted. Upset that your company only gave you $250 reimbursement for working from home, when millions are unemployed. I can’t even fathom a million people unemployed. The words come out and I can’t even imagine a crowd that large, not having an income, not knowing how they’ll eat or pay rent. 

I hate it I hate it I hate it

And this is why I don’t do tech outside of work. The only progress in this industry is for the rich. It’s the same as any other industry controlled by singular white men whose worth is in the Billions. 

I don’t want to see homeless people on the streets of Seattle anymore (and not like Bellevue, which is just a nightmare) I don’t want the person behind the cash register to worry about health insurance or making their next payment. 

I’m angry. If I dive any deeper, I’m gonna give myself carpal tunnel again. 

I read that [essay about abolishing work](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/bob-black-the-abolition-of-work) and despite the impossibility of it (for probably the rest of my lifetime), I still subscribe to it. Not just for myself, though that is how I came upon the article, out of my own misery at work. But for the millions of people out there who have shittier jobs, shittier lives, and have had to choose between one shitty option and another shittier option. Where does humanity go from here? We’re driving ourselves into extinction because the few at the top won’t acknowledge the existence of the many.

There was [a reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/io9o0u/til_in_1981_a_harvard_law_professor_published_a/) I saw today from TIL. A guy had proposed that for a president to use the nuclear codes, they first needed to kill a volunteer with a sword or something. Then they might think twice about pushing a button to kill millions not in sight. That’s how I wish the world worked. I wish that being so “connected” didn’t simultaneously disconnect us from our humanity. I wish humans didn’t have number insensitivity or numbness (whatever the phrase is). 

My life in this bubble is perfect, but my bubble isn’t opaque. And it sucks to see that I’m part of the lucky exception and there’s such a thing as the unlucky majority.
