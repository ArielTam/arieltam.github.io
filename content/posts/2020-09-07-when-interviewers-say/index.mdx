S.O. brought up a valid point earlier. If I’m so miserable, why don’t I switch companies? Or study leetcode at least so I can ace the interviews? I didn’t have an answer except that leetcode is one of my least favorite things in the world. And then S.O. threw a [Tesla frontend interview question](https://www.glassdoor.com/Interview/Tesla-UI-Engineer-Interview-Questions-EI_IE43129.0,5_KO6,17.htm) at me while I was chaotically trying to make a chicken pesto pasta for us as fast as possible (I basically said “omw” to my old housemates who were waiting to get started on Discord even though I was clearly not "omw"). I came up with an answer just thinking out loud in the matter of probably 1 minute and it had like O(N) space complexity and time complexity (which I'm really proud of). S.O. arrived at the same solution, except he used an object (hashmap) instead of a 2D array.

I have the foundations, I just need time and effort to strengthen and build upon them. I hate that interviewing is like a *Specialized Skill* and that I have to study for it but I guess when you pit one candidate who studied against another who didn’t, then it’s clear who wants the job more (or who is willing to go the extra mile — all those great soft skills of loyalty and grit and initiative). It’s not really a technical interview in the end then, cuz those “technical” skills are 99.9% of the time not going to be used in that tech job anyway. 

It should be called the “How Much Do You Want This?” interview. Are you willing to give up your brain space and your weeknights to study useless crap as a down payment of servitude to our company? If yes, then you pass. If no or your study habits suck so even if you did study but we don’t think you did, then bye bye. I’m so over all that bullshit of “we just wanna know how you think”. There are plenty better ways than string manipulation and sorting to find out how someone thinks critically.

Honestly, take home projects are probably the most effective way. That’s like nearly exact to what the normal job requires. Sitting, thinking for a long time, coding, refactoring, testing, etc. But who knows if I’d actually ace those either. 

I don’t know why I treat work like school so much. I mean I know why. It’s 16 years of conditioning, which is SIXTY NINE PERCENT of my entire life. But I’m aware of that, so why can’t I stop?
