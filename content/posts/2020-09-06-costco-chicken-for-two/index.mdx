Last week, we were happy. Our fridge was empty and we were gonna come home with a feast.Warm, dripping in caramelized juices, ready to be savagely ripped apart at the ligaments. And best of all, it was only $5! My god, it's the deal of a century.

Seeping into my excitement, I became more and more anxious with each day that passed. I wasn't exactly imagining mold spores growing, but I knew time was ticking and one day, I would open up that greasy plastic top and get a big whiff of DEAD CHICKEN. 

Not tasty chicken! *THE ACTUAL SMELL OF DEATH.*

No matter! I was up for the challenge. Chicken every meal. When all the meat would be gone, I'd use the bones to make a rich chicken broth, even though it's summer and it's too hot for soup. 

Little did I know, this was truly the wrongest week to commit to chicken every meal. 

It started out so good in the beginning. The dreadful white meat was transformed into a tender, *cheesy chicken enchilada*. Bueno.

The next day, during our lunch break, I tossed us a quick *chicken salad*. SO said it was one of the best lunches he ever had. I grinned in pride. I was doing fantastic! Soon enough, this entire chicken would be finished off, one satisfying meal at a time, and nothing would go to waste.

We had a long weekend coming up, and SO's birthday right at the start of it. So instead of one day of celebration, it became a week of celebration. Nothing wrong with that, right? 

I didn't see any of it coming. 

First, I got some sort of viral infection. Could it have been COVID? Maybe, but unlikely. I was shitting twice, no, thrice as normal. And they started out as good shits, the solid one log type. But then they started falling apart and by mid-week I was having diarrhea. No chicken for me, I guess. Just white rice (and a few sneaky bites of cupcakes).

Then, the smokeless grill happened.

See, SO's Grandma bought him a surprise present and it arrived it in a massive, unlabeled cardboard box. My first two thoughts about it when we yanked it out were, "is this a printer?" and "our apartment has no room for this. I wanna sell it." Unfortunately, this smokeless grill (one of those As Seen On TV gimmicks) was a gift from dear Grandma. There was no way that SO would let me off that easily. So we thought and thought and SO came to the conclusion, why don't we just try it out once?

To my utter surprise, SO PUT ON HIS MASK AND BACKPACK AND IMMEDIATELY SET OFF FOR A SOLO GROCERY TRIP. HE CAME BACK WITH 2.65 LBS OF RIBEYE. AND FOUR BOTTLES OF PINOT GRIGIO. THIS GUY WAS EXCITED. And so two dinners were zapped away with tummies full of smokeless-grilled steak (at this point the diarrhea had subsided and the chicken had been untouched for 3-4 days). Now that I think about it, that didn't make a huge dent, but emotionally it did. Emotionally it did.

Finally, SO became so sick of HEARING me say "we have chicken in fridge", I was the only one eating it. One of those dreadful weekdays, I sat at the kitchen table eating my *sad chicken rice*. SO came in and began making eggs on toast. My heart fell.

Before this all began, I wrote up a list of all the things I could make with the chicken. A single tear is symbolically rolling down my face right now. I will not buy a Costco chicken during birthday week ever again.
