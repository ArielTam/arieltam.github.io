Dear Person who revs their engine during the Ungodly Hours of the Night / Morning while passing through or exiting the garage below us,

I hope the Happiness you derive from those several thunderous seconds equal the amount of collective Unhappiness from everyone woken up by that ugly, blood-boiling CAR-cophony. 

Sometimes I wake up in terror because I think a race car is going smash through my second story window. Most times I wake up in utter annoyance, which is not how I want to start my day. 

However, I wonâ€™t continue to harbor these feelings of hate even if you continue to conjure them until your car sputters out one day because you revved it to Death.

So I forgive you for wrecking my sleep. I forgive you for instilling a gut fear of THAT sound which I can never forget. I forgive you for *being a dick to me*.

But no one else probably will.

Go live your sad life. 

Goodbye.
