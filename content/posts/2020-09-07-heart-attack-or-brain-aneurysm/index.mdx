We watched s4e9 of [H&CF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halt_and_Catch_Fire_(TV_series)) and it was a bummer.

  Gordon (one of the titular characters!) died in the previous episode and this one was entirely about the whole gang packing up his belongings and mourning his loss.

It made me really depresso and terrified that I might lose SO that easily. It’s just always a shock when I’m reminded of how real mortality is. Most often I just shrug it off, I can’t take it seriously. And then something like this just destroys me and I start crying and telling SO how important he is to me. I wish I could keep that in the forefront of my mind but not in an emotionally destructive way. Like yeah, we don’t know when any of us will die so treat each other like you really mean it, like how you want them to remember you or how you want to remember them. Because one day, it will come and you would want to know if your heart that you did your best.

I wonder if that’s just another human condition, something that our brain had to erase in order to survive as a species. Like how we can only focus on a few things and our brain purposely filters to keep it from going into data overload. Mortality is just too much to deal with while simultaneously trying to stay alive. For me, it sounds like they go hand in hand, but I can’t seem to remember that when I’m upset at SO for not doing his fair share of chores or when I’m upset at myself for having a tummy or not doing “well” at work.

SO actually brought up a valid point earlier. If I’m so miserable, why don’t I switch companies? Or study leetcode at least so I can ace the interviews? I didn’t have an answer except that leetcode is one of my least favorite things in the world. And then SO threw a [Tesla frontend interview question](https://www.glassdoor.com/Interview/Tesla-UI-Engineer-Interview-Questions-EI_IE43129.0,5_KO6,17.htm) at me while I was chaotically trying to make a chicken pesto pasta for us as fast as possible (I basically said “omw” to my old housemates who were waiting to get started on Discord even though I was clearly not "omw"). I came up with an answer just thinking out loud in the matter of probably 1 minute and it had like O(N) space complexity and time complexity. SO arrived at the same solution, except he used an object (hashmap) instead of a 2D array.

I have the foundations, I just need time and effort to strengthen and build upon them. I hate that interviewing is like a *Specialized Skill* and that I have to study for it but I guess when you pit one candidate who studied against another who didn’t, then it’s clear who wants the job more (or who is willing to go the extra mile — all those great soft skills of loyalty and grit and initiative). It’s not really a technical interview in the end then, cuz those “technical” skills are 99.9% of the time not going to be used in that tech job anyway. 

It should be called the “How Much Do You Want This?” interview. Are you willing to give up your brain space and your weeknights to study useless crap as a down payment of servitude to our company? If yes, then you pass. If no or your study habits suck so even if you did study but we don’t think you did, then bye bye. I’m so over all that bullshit of “we just wanna know how you think”. There are plenty better ways than string manipulation and sorting to find out how someone thinks critically.

Honestly, take home projects are probably the most effective way. That’s like nearly exact to what the normal job requires. Sitting, thinking for a long time, coding, refactoring, testing, etc. But who knows if I’d actually ace those either. 

I don’t know why I treat work like school so much. I mean I know why. It’s 16 years of conditioning, which is SIXTY NINE PERCENT of my entire life. But I’m aware of that, so why can’t I stop? 

These... “institutions”.... are so powerful. They make you so insignificant. They make you habitual. They make you feel alone. But at the same time, they make you THINK if you work hard enough, you would get what you deserve. A place at the top. I unconsciously keep striving for that A and when I don’t, I feel like a  C student. I wanna just kick down that whole concept of grades and ranking and competition and achievement. I wish it could just be as easy and mindless as sleeping.

Humanity is a weird thing. 

I’m trying to comprehend the mass scale of ignorance and disbelief and sheer forgetfulness of the American population on topic of a world pandemic. Even people I know and respect because they’re intelligent and make good choices — this pandemic happens and they turn their back on it. There was CHAOS and now there’s (wow I have blanked on my favorite word to use) COMPLACENCY. People are socializing and eating and going through airports to get on planes and land in another airport. The germs 🦠 are everywhere but in the minds of the people. It’s just unbelievable. I feel guilty for cancelling plans! But logic says you shouldn't even be making plans in the first place! Everyone preaches the phrase “social distancing” like it's the Golden Rule but then it’s okay to go hang out with your 5 or 6 friends and talk and eat and share the same air and the same risk of catching the virus and then carrying it with you to another person. 

If it had the kind of stigma that HIV does (hello, does *virus* ring a bell?), people wouldn’t be treating it like a seasonal allergy. Or worse, a joke or conspiracy. 

I thought about the relevance of Taylor’s new album name, [“folklore”](https://twitter.com/taylorswift13/status/1286513561553047557), and how she described it as a collection of stories that you don’t know whether they’re true or not, but they live on anyway. This idea of truth feels almost hopeless to me. It lost its value. It only works if it’s a collective agreement, and I’m at a loss now because people don’t even believe in reason anymore. 

I have complete faith in science and in the systems of science, how it discovers truth and rediscovers truth as our methods advance. But for some huge population of the nation (of which I am sheltered from), "science" is distrustful. "Science" is drama. What once was objective is now subjective. How does one turn the ship around when the the people can't even agree on a compass north?

Recently, I’ve gained a lot of appreciation for reporters because I guess I would consider them truth finders. Reporters from Vox or NYT or NPR. But then I think about those "news" outlets like Fox News and it makes me sick.

Sometimes I wonder if I’m some kind of liberal robot and I’m preventing myself from understanding their point of view because it’s not my own. But I’ve tried, really. It just doesn’t make sense to me how you could sit with so many lies, so much corruption, so much fear, say you’re a representative of the People and not die of a heart attack or brain aneurysm. Because you clearly don't deserve or *have* either one if you’re that kind of person.

I’m enraged. These people are the top aren’t ignorant or uneducated. They’re selfish and dangerous and there's no one to stop them.
