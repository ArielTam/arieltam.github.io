I had a thought when I was doing my daily calm this morning. 

Maybe, my mom has been right all along. 

I’ve always thought it was strange that my mom would climb all the way up to a Masters degree and then give it all up to take care of me and my siblings. Since then, she’s never taken up a full time job. I used to think, how does she deal with all that free time? How does she not get antsy? How does she deal with the fact that she isn’t making any money? I felt it was almost parasitic, which in hindsight, is just completely wrong. I didn’t give my mom credit for everything my dad put on her because she was “just sitting at home”, everything me and my siblings asked of her because she was “always around”. I didn’t give her credit for how she had to self-motivate and self-learn with no schedule and no authority figure. I struggle immensely with the idea of free time, the need to be productive and climb to the top and gain recognition from peers. My mom somehow is able to disregard all the stigmas of not working and make something worthwhile of her time. 

Sure, I can’t always relate or understand, but she seems to find the most peculiar, niche things on the internet. She devours knowledge from books and courses. I always thought the new age stuff was a coping mechanism for the difficulties at home and whatever past traumas she may have had, but I don’t think it’s like that anymore. She’s evolving into a new chapter of her life, doing what makes her happy. When my dad eventually retires, I think he’ll have a lot to learn from my mom about how to spend his time. And same with my grandpa, he could learn a lot from my mom or Ah-Ma, who I just realized is also a stay-at-home mother. 

I wish our culture honored stay-at-parents. Like really gave them credit for the incredible work they do in providing for the family and staying sane themselves in a world that does not value them at the level they are worth. There’s the glorification of the career parent, the single working parent, and I get that those deserves merit too, but not in a way that diminishes the other role. 

I’m still trying to figure out how I can have a fulfilling, happy life. Right now, the working mom path is not looking so hot to me right now. I have so much to unlearn so I can take better care of myself. I want to stop stressing myself out on things that don’t actually matter. I want to live more simply. 

Like most girls, I wanted to be a mom every since I was little. I think I tried to convince myself that if I was gonna be a mom, I’d be a working mom. But not a negligent one! I’d balance being a CTO, AND a mom, AND a wife, and at that point, it would be easy cuz I’d already have become the PERFECT human being. All grown up and capable of anything. 

I am barely taking care of myself as is and when my mom was my age, she was three years away from giving birth to me. No, thank you! If I’m being real with myself, by the time I’m thirty or thirty-five and ready to have kids, I’m just gonna quit my job and be a mom. No more leaning in, [I gonna lay down](https://www.aliwong.com/deargirls)! Wfh permanently. I wanna fit in a “ ~~working hard~~ or hardly working” joke somewhere but I can’t seem to WORK it in. 

> WELL, WE DON’T WANNA WORK.

-- me and S.O., shrieking in our apartment at 1am

Jokes aside, I still have social justice aspirations. Be a hero! Change the world! I don’t know where they fit into all this. I guess it’s a conversation I’ll have with myself another time.
