### "It's Never Too Cheesy" Chicken Enchilada

Serves 4 people (unless you're 2 hungry people). PRE oven to 400F.

##### For the sauce
| Amount  | Ingredient     | Opinions                                                                                     |
|---------|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 cup   | marinara sauce | it's always good to have a ton of pasta sauce in stock (what if you have an apocalypse??) |
| 1 tsp   | paprika        |                                                                                           |
| 1 tsp   | garlic powder  |                                                                                           |
| 1/2 tsp | chili powder   | or more if you like it SPICY                                                              |
| 1/2 tsp | cumin          |                                                                                           |

Warm up some of the marinara sauce in a small sauce pan. Override all the Italian flavors from the pasta sauce with smoky and spicy flavors to make it taste Mexican. Stir rigorously and set aside.

##### For the filling
| Amount     | Ingredient      | Opinions                                                        |
|------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 cup      | Costco Chicken™ | but the white meat only. ask your SO to shred it for you.    |
| 4-5 sprigs | cilantro        | even if your SO has the soap gene, you gonna hide it anyway. |
| 1/2        | onion           | diced                                                        |
| 2 tbsp     | salsa verde     | the one from Trader Joe's was on sale :)                     |

Saute the onion until it is soft and translucent. Like if you ate it right now, you would be okay with that. Dump the shredded chicken in and put enough water to just cover the surface of the pan. But don't drown that chicken, it's already dead for goddsake. You just need to steam it a bit and make it soft and juicy again. When you don't see any water and it's saucy looking, put the cilantro and salsa verde in and mix it up. And then some of the enchilada sauce too, for color only. 

##### Assembly
| Amount | Ingredients                | Opinions                  |
|--------|----------------------------|------------------------|
| a bag  | tortillas                  | the smallish ones (6") |
| a bag  | shredded mozzarella cheese | why is it so expensive   |

Spread that sauce on one face of the tortilla like it's a pizza, except all the way to the edges. Go really heavy on the sauce. Sprinkle a fat handful of mozzarella down the center column and dump some of the chicken filling on top. You can put more cheese on top if your SO demands it be extra cheesy. Then roll it up and put it neatly into a baking pan. 

When you've done this part a billion times or until the pan is sardined up with little unbaked enchiladas, it's finally time for the BIG SPRINKLE. Put your hands into the bag of cheese and take a huge handful, like you're grubby toddler reaching for goldfish. Pull your hand out gracefully; don't let go of any little shreds! Drop it over the sardined enchiladas and shake your hand around so there are no uneven lumps. Repeat as necessary and until you envision it is the optimal thickness for the perfect cheese pull.

Stick that pan into the oven for 10-15 minutes, or until the cheese starts looking like a toasted tortilla itself, freckled but still creamy white (wow like my SO). Take it out and dig in immediately!!!

### "This is one of the best lunches I've ever had" Sesame Chicken Salad

Serves 2 people.

##### At the cutting board
| Amount    | Ingredients                             | Opinions                                                                      |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1/4       | cabbage (or lettuce or something green) |                                                                               |
| 1         | carrot                                  |                                                                               |
| 1 cup     | Costco Chicken™                         | again, it tastes better if your SO shreds it, but sometimes he's too busy :'( |
| 10 sprigs | cilantro                                | OPTIONAL (only if you have the soap gene)                                     |

Cut the cabbage or whatever you're using as the healthiest part of this salad into confetti shreds, between a centimeter and half a centimeter thick. 

Julienne your carrots too. They should be a similar thickness and no longer than two inches (that's as big as my jaw can open, ok?).

*Optional:* Roll up the cilantro tightly and cut into tiny pieces.

Aggressively dump these all into a nice serving bowl and mix to combine. 

##### Dressing
| Amount     | Ingredients    | Opinions                                                                                   |
|------------|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 tsp      | sesame oil     |                                                                                            |
| 1 tsp      | rice vinegar   |                                                                                            |
| 1 tsp      | teriyaki sauce | from your last takeout meal                                                                |
| a sprinkle | sesame seeds   | (OPTIONAL) if you're tryna be extra and you're okay with seeds getting stuck in your teeth |

Pour each of these directly into the salad bowl and toss it all together for at least 30 seconds so it is evenly distributed.

##### Super Deluxe Croutons
| Amount  | Ingredients                 | Opinions                        |
|---------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------|
| 1 slice | sandwich bread              |                                 |
| a US-quarter-sized dollop   | olive oil                   |                                 |
| 1/4 tsp | Santa Maria steak seasoning | it's a versatile flavoring, ok. |

Cut up your white bread into crouton squares. I toasted it beforehand, but I don't actually know if it makes a difference. 

Pour the olive oil into a heated pan and move it around. You want to see tiny beads of oil, not one amoeba. Sprinkle some of that Santa Maria seasoning onto the oil and drop all the white bread cubes in, too. Toss your pan up and down. It makes you look like a pro and it ensures the cubes are coated on all sides. Wow! 

When they seem toasty, take it off the heat. Taste it. Now put it in your salad. NOW EAT IT!

| 1/4 cup    | Costco Chicken™ | shredded. by you.                                                             |

| 1/4 tsp    | sesame oil      |                                                                               |

Put this all in a small bowl, microwave for a minute and enjoy as much as you can. Don't think about how you've been eating the same chicken carcass for days now and your SO is sitting on your right, obliviously chomping away at two golden runny eggs on toast.
